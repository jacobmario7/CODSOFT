# CodSoft Internship Project Repository
## Welcome to the CodSoft Internship Project Repository!


## Project Overview
This repository hosts the codebase for three exciting machine learning projects developed during my internship at CodSoft. These projects encompass diverse domains, showcasing the versatility and practical applications of machine learning techniques.

## Project Highlights
### 1.Flower Type Prediction using Iris Dataset:
- Implemented machine learning models to predict the types of flowers based on features from the famous Iris dataset.
- Utilized popular classification algorithms to achieve accurate predictions.
- Detailed analysis and visualizations provided to understand the dataset and model performance.
### 2.Credit Card Fraud Detection:
- Developed a robust fraud detection system using advanced machine learning techniques.
- Utilized anomaly detection algorithms to identify fraudulent transactions.
- Evaluated model performance metrics and fine-tuned parameters for optimal results.
### 3.Sales Prediction:
- Built predictive models to forecast sales for CodSoft's products/services.
- Leveraged time-series analysis and regression techniques to generate accurate sales predictions.
- Incorporated external factors and seasonal trends for enhanced forecasting accuracy.
